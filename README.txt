This is a chemistry equation computer and simulator, the initial design was to calculate gas laws such as the ideal gas law and the
van der waals equation for you, as well as simulating and visualizing the movement of gas particles within a box and how they change 
with adjusted variables.

However, I realised I could just do 17 more chemistry equations in the calculator, and 3 more simulations. The initial purpose was
to match the molecular dynamics nature of the coursework piece, but extra detail was added to flesh out the use of the application.

The GUI for the calculator may seem quite basic, but I spent a lot of time adjusting it just to take it back to this sleek and intuitive
design that's very usable and accomplishes the task at hand.

To run, open the main.py file in a programme such a spyder, and press run. It should open a GUI that has some green text present,
if the text is not green, shut down any GUI's open and press run again. This is something I can't explain but it seems to happen sometimes.

The calculator should tell you off if you don't do this, but input all the variable fields bar one, and press calculate. It should,
and has according to all testing thus far, calculate the missing variable correctly. Ensure your units are correct for the equation,
that is simplest when left up to the user as unit adjustability is possible depending on variation of the equation the user wishes to use.

The simulators are very simple and are meant to show mathematical relationships in chemistry, they visualize this well and are supplemental
to using the calculator and are meant to aid understanding.
